    <h1>Meet my Squishmallows</h1>
    <main>
        <p>My very first Squishmallow I had gotten from Costco (unrelated but I love Costco) and his name is Ollie
            (short for Oliver) the Owl. He's very cute and soft and he hold's a special place in my heart because he was
            my first Squishmallow ever.
        </p>
        <p>My second Squishmallow is also from Costco and his name is Draco the Dragon. He's got green scales down his
            back and a pointy tail. I remember I was between getting the dragon and an otter, but I asked my older
            brother who had accompanied me on the Costco run and he had sided with the dragon.
        </p>
        <p>My third and last (for now) Squishmallow is a miniature one from Five Below. I am still mad that I didn't buy
            more at the time because when I had returned a few days later to look for Squishmallows to gift to my
            younger cousins, they had all been sold out. There was such a variety of mini Squishmallows to choose from
            and I picked an adorable sloth. His tag said his name was Simon and the tag description said his name
            was James so I introduce you to Simon James the Sloth.
        </p>
        <p>I am on the hunt for more as I have become obsessed with my current ones. Every few weeks, I drive to
            approximately 5 different stores in my area that might have them to keep an eye out for new ones. I highly
            suggest everyone to get a Squishmallow at one point in their life since they are amazing. :)
